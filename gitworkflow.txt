First Contribution/ Setup:



___________________________________________________
1. Clone the repository



	git clone <url copied form clone or download button>





2. Create a branch



	cd <repo directory>

 



	git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>





3. Make necessary changes and commit those changes

 



- make changes in the files
 
 



	git add <file> or 	//adds specific files changed
 

	git add .		//adds all files changed

 



	git commit -m "(my commit will)<enter message here."

	
- repeat (add and commit) as many times as needed. Could be semi-frequent / when reaching a "checkpoint"




4. Push changes to GitHub (when your changes are in a working/semi-working state)

 



	git push origin <add-you-branch-name>





5. Sumbit your changes for review (pull request ~< 250 lines of code)

 



- go to the GitHub Repository and you'll see a Compare & Pull request
 
 


- click on that button

 



- description: WHAT changed, WHY your pull request exists, HOW it does what it set out to do

 



- maybe @mention individuals that you want involved

	git branch -d <branch_name>		//removes locally
	git push origin --delete <the_remote_branch_name>	//removes in github

8. Pull changes from repository into your local workspace

	git pull

9. Repeat steps 2 - 8
