## General info
Stakeholders are specifically people who work in a field that has a rapidly and dynamically evolving jargon, such as medical professionals and software engineers. This is application is important and relevant because someone who works in such a field will often be confronted with terminology that they are not familiar with, and maybe in the position to coin a new word for a process or procedure that they originate. By allowing users to create their own words, our application will, therefore, have a high degree of applicability for these professions. Specifically, this application is intended to be deployed within an organization (such as a large tech company for example) to keep track of internal terminology.
